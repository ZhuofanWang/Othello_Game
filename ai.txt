1. Did you attempt to make your computer player very smart
-- i.e., do something more clever than just pick a random legal move?
Answer:
Yes. The computer player I sign will choose the cell which will flip the tile to get the longest list of the computer_color tiles. 

2. If so, were you able to accomplish this?
Is your computer player as smart as you would like?
Answer:
Yes.
Yes.

3. How did you determine which piece to play next?
Tell us about your “pick next move” algorithm
Answer:
To choose the next step of the computer, I use a dictionary to help check
Currently legal cells. I loop through 64 cells, check each cell, and if it is valid, I make it as a keyword in my dictionary. Meanwhile, I note down the
disks that can be flipped as a list if the computer takes this cell as computer move.
So finally I will get a dictionary whose key value pairs are legal moves
and the corresponding disks to flip.

4. How often did your computer program beat you, or your friends,
or whoever tested it out for you?
The computer beats me 50% or so.

5. How would you improve it in the future?
In the future, I would set a timer for this game.
